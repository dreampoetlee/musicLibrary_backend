## Learning Objective
Build a REST web API in Django REST Framework and test each endpoint in Postman.
## Technologies
Python, Django REST Framework, Postman
## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to make good, consistent commits.

- As a developer, I want to create a Song model:
  - Property names must be in snake_case and match the following exactly!
    - title - CharField
    - artist - CharField
    - album - CharField
    - release_date - DateField
    - genre - CharField

- As a developer, I want my API to serve content on the following URLs paths:
  - Paths must match these exactly!
    - ‘music/'
    - ‘music/<int:pk>/’

- As a developer, I want to build a REST web API in Django REST Framework, so that I can make HTTP requests interact with the data set.

- As a developer, I want to create a GET endpoint the responds with a 200 success status code and all of the songs within the Music table.

- As a developer, I want to create a GET by id endpoint that does the following things:
  - Accepts a value from the request’s URL (The id of the song to retrieve).
  - Returns a 200 status code.
  - Responds with the song in the database that has the id that was sent through the URL.

- As a developer, I want to create a POST endpoint that does the following things:
  - Accepts a body object from the request in the form of a Song model.
  - Adds the new song to the database.
  - Returns a 201 status code.
  - Responds with the newly created song object.

- As a developer, I want to create a PUT endpoint that does the following things:
  - Accepts a value from the request’s URL (The id of the song to be updated).
  - Accepts a body object from the request in the form of a Song model.
  - Finds the song in the Music table and updates that song with the properties that were sent in the request’s body.
  - Returns a 200 status code.
  - Responds with the newly updated song object.

- As a developer, I want to create a DELETE endpoint that does the following things:
  - Accepts a value from the request’s URL.
  - Returns a 200 status code.
  - Responds with the song in the database that has just been deleted.

- As a developer, I want to use Postman to make a POST, PUT, DELETE, and both GET requests (get by id and get all) request to my REST web API, save it to a collection, and then export it as a JSON from Postman.

BONUS

- As a developer, I want to add the ability to “like” a song through the web API and have the number of likes saved in the database with the song.
